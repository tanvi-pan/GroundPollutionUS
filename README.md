# GroundPollutionUS
Recently cheaper ground-level pollution quantification methods are replacing PM2.5 monitors. This project aims to use two new pollution metrics, AOD and QMAC, to predict traditional pollution values. We use various models including boosted trees and random forest to see if these cost-effective metrics accurately predict pollution levels.
